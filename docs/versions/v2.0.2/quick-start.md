To run `treefmt` in your project, follow these steps:

1. [Install] `treefmt`.
2. Ensure any formatters you wish to use are also installed e.g. `gofmt`
3. Run `treefmt --init` to generate a basic configuration file `treefmt.toml`.
4. Edit `treefmt.toml`, [configuring] formatters as desired.
5. Run `treefmt` anywhere in your project to format the whole tree.

[install]: install.md
[configuring]: configure.md
